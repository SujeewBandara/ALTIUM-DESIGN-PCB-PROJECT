# ALTIUM-PCB-DESIGN-PROJECT
## Designing a Power Regulator &amp; Shield Board for Arduino Uno
I'm thrilled to announce the successful completion of the Altium Education guided project, where I dived into the fascinating world of PCB design. In this project, I meticulously crafted a Power Regulator Shield for the Arduino Uno, orchestrating a symphony of LEDs and optimizing power distribution.

The board, affectionately termed a "shield," elegantly perches on the standard Arduino Uno, establishing connections through standard pin headers. This innovative design not only illuminates a bank of LEDs but also assumes control over key power functions on the Arduino Uno.

Through the meticulous application of engineering tasks, I've navigated the entire process of designing a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), ensuring seamless integration and efficient power supply. The successful completion of this project signifies not just the mastery of PCB design but also a creative approach to enhancing Arduino Uno functionality.
